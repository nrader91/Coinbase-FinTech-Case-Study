# Unit 1 - FinTech Case Study

## An in depth look into Coinbase

### Overview and Origin

* Coinbase

* Coinbase was incorporated on June 20th, 2012.

* Founders = Brian Armstrong & Fred Ehrsam.

* CEO Brian Armstrong saw the benefits of Bitcoin early on and wanted to create a place where people could freely buy & sell bitcoin. He has stated that he saw firsthand how Argentina crumbled due to inflation and felt crypto currency was a valuable way to protect against that.

* Coinbase is funded by charging fees for its brokerage and exchange.  It also custodians user funds, like a bank, and decides which crypto assets to list, like the NASDAQ or NYSE.  Coinbase has received $847.3M in funding over 14 rounds. 



### Business Activities:

* Coinbase is trying to have a safe easy to use all in one spot place to buy/sell/exchange crypto currencies.  It was started with a focus in Bitcoin but is now moving towards a NYSE type model for all cryptos.

* Their intended customer is the world.  They want to create an open financial market for anyone to use.  I see it being useful to everyday people & retail traders.  If you look broadly at the platform, it is easy to use and designed for beginners to crypto training.

* Market size? They have 56million active users. They had 35 million users in 2020 so that is close to 20 million new users in the last year. They are bringing on new users daily.

* Coinbase is the largest U.S. regulated crypto exchange. They offer the same services as other crypto exchanges but they are taking advantage of the fact that they are one of the oldest and most well-known.  They had an IPO in April of 2021. And they are backed by banks such as JP Morgan.  They are capitalizing on the emerging industry to bring on many new customers each year.

* Coinbase uses REST API to integrate bitcoin payments into your business or personal applications. 



### Landscape:

* Coinbase would fit into both the cryptocurrency & personal investment domains of the financial industry.

* Over the last 5-10 years Cryptocurrency turned from something that was barley understood or a rumor to a household name.  The technology & industry is constantly expanding and innovating with no end in sight.  One of the largest trends that has affected cryptocurrency is the widespread acceptance of major companies.  Just in the last few months companies such as PayPal & Tesla have started accepting cryptocurrency (mainly Bitcoin) in payments. Companies like Coinbase are offering services of both crypto storage and exchanges.  This acceptance has caused the value of Bitcoin and other cryptos to explode in 2021.  

* Several major companies are Coinbase, Binance, and Robinhood to name a few.  The reason why these companies are the major players are because they are cheap or free to use and extremely easy for regular people to begin using/learning/trading with cryptos.  



### Results

* So far Coinbase has made it possible for millions of people to buy, sell, exchange, and hold cryptocurrencies since its creation.  The company’s IPO on 4/14/21 made it one of the first major cryptocurrency companies to be traded on the Nasdaq.

* Several major core metrics companies in this domain track are verified users, assets on the platform, total revenue, and net income.

* As of Q1 in 2021 here are Coinbase’s metrics. 
a.	Verified users: 56 million. 
b.	Assets on platform: $223 Billion.
c.	Total Revenue: $1.8 Billion.
d.	Net Income: $730-800 Million. 

* Coinbase is doing very well as a company with both personal growth and compared to competitors.  Growth sustained – total revenue in 2020 was $1.1 B compared to $1.8 B just in Q1 of 2021.  They are up to 56 million users from 35 million in 2020.  All of 2020 they brought in $322 M compared to $730 M in Q1 this year.

* Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and are within the same domain as Coinbase.  It is estimated they brought in around $1 B in profit in 2020.  This shows that Coinbase is comparable with larger competitors. 



### Recommendations

* I have experience using several retail trading platforms.  I have a personal account set up on Coinbase.  The number one service I would suggest to the company to implement a high-level customizable charting tool.

* The company focus is to be the largest most widely used crypto exchange, I believe they can do that if they have their platform a “one stop shop” for crypto traders.  They would keep their customers inside the app for due diligence and research thus more likely to retain customers and cause those customers to spend more money. 

* This tool could utilize many features such as interactive brokers, customization tools, robo-advisors.  

* Basically, the idea is to make Coinbase more interactive and personable for the user.  If I spend a lot of time creating charting for my favorite cryptocurrencies within Coinbase, every time I want to check out that coin, I will go onto Coinbase to use my chart.  The more time each user spends within the Coinbase platform the more willing they are to use services.  Thus, making each user more profitable.
